Quick books: 

Not sure if you need installing QuickBooks itself (I did)
Install QBFC13 SDK from here: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/get-started/older-versions-of-the-desktop-sdk

After installing SDK you should have QBFC13Lib problem resolves itself (restart VS and reload the project)

InDesign:

For indesign you need to install InDesign CS 4 from "Distib" folder under Designer4 on Server2. Don't need for Creative Cloud.

Adobe InDesign CS4 (from Designer4 / Distrib) 
- First enter 1037-1613-3543-1719-2183-1809, 
Then for existing product select CS and enter: 1037-1206-7287-8753-3339-5530 (itâ€™s all legitimate data, not a crack)

You may need to run InDesign as Admin once to let it register COM components.
You may need to remove and add again InDesign library in VS project by adding COM (!) Reference to "Adobe InDesign CS4 Type Library"
